# Challenge #2 - Palindrome Detector

From Merriam Webster, a palindrome is a "word, verse, or sentence (such as “Able was I ere I saw Elba”) or a number (such as 1881) that reads the same backward or forward."  Read more about palindromes [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome) or see some interesting examples [here](http://examples.yourdictionary.com/palindrome-examples.html).

## Overview
> For this week's challenge, you must create a function called `is_palindrome` that takes in a string and returns True or False, depending on whether or not it is a palindrome

#### Input:
A single word given as a string consisting of only lowercase letter characters without any punctuation

#### Output:
The program should output a boolean value - True if the string is a palindrome, False if it isn't.

#### Examples:
```
is_palindrome("kayak") => True
is_palindrome("racecar") => True
is_palindrome("raspberry") => False
```

## Extension
Try to make the program ignore any spaces, numbers, punctuation, and/or capitalization passed by the user.
